<h4>Speaker and Talk Info</h4>

<h4>Keynote 1: Chandra Krintz (University of California, Santa Barbara)</h4>

    <h5 class="highlight"> Title: Sustainable IoT Systems for Digital Agriculture</h5>
 <br>
    <h5 class="highlight">Abstract:
        The Internet of Things (IoT) has great potential for extending human perception and automating intelligent actuation and control of cyber-physical systems. However, its adoption and wide spread use is nascent. A key reason for this is that IoT deployments are vastly heterogenous with widely varying resource constraints which makes them very challenging to program, deploy, secure, and maintain. Further, many of the most compelling use cases from climate resilience, disaster prediction and response, ecology and agriculture, etc. require deployments that are remote, inaccessible, hostile to electronics, that lack power infrastructure (forcing reliance on batteries), and span trust domains (edge versus cloud).

        Our research focuses on new approaches that simplify the development and management of IoT applications in these settings. In particular, we have designed a new programming system that makes AI/ML applications portable across the edge-cloud continuum, robust to faults and intermittent connectivity, and easier to deploy and manage. We enable this through a novel combination of a distributed serverless runtime, dataflow programming abstractions, and intelligent deployment optimizations. We design, test, and evaluate these advances using real applications for digital agriculture (as part of the UCSB SmartFarm project). We find that they simplify IoT software development and deployment while reducing energy consumption significantly.

<h4>Keynote 2: Andrew A. Chien (University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory)</h4>

    <h5 class="highlight"> Title: Reduce Datacenter Operational Carbon and leverage that Efficiency to reduce the Water-use and Embodied Carbon</h5>
 <br>
    <h5 class="highlight">Abstract:
 AI and Cloud computing is growing rapidly and projected to increase US electric power consumption by as much as 2% by 2026 (EIA). Such rapid growth is a significant challenge to power grid stability and decarbonization. With datacenter loads at 15%, even 25% in several grids, datacenter growth is browning the grid. We will discuss how computing flexibility could help the grid decarbonize (Zero-carbon cloud), and how generative AI applications such as ChatGPT can be greened. The key is cooperation between datacenter loads and power grids.

Operational carbon, water-use, and embodied carbon are often viewed as disconnected sustainability challenges. They are intimately connected. We illustrate this connection, and first show how the progress in operational carbon can be used to reduce datacenter water-use and associated biodiversity loss. Second, we will show how reductions in operational carbon can be used to reduce the embodied carbon and increase the carbon-efficiency of computing.

<h4>Invited Talk 1: Shaolei Ren (University of California, Riverside)</h4>

    <h5 class="highlight"> Title: The Hidden Water Footprint of AI</h5>
 <br>
    <h5 class="highlight">Abstract:
  The growing carbon footprint of artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large ones such as GPT and LLaMA, has been undergoing public scrutiny. However, the equally important and enormous water footprint of AI models has mostly remained under the radar. Importantly, the global AI demand is projected to account for 4.2 -- 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 -- 6 Denmark. This is very concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting freshwater resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, AI can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing its own water footprint. In this talk, I will present a principled methodology to estimate AI’s water footprint, followed by a software-based approach to reducing the water footprint by exploiting spatial-temporal diversities of AI models' runtime water efficiency. Finally, I will discuss how to holistically and equitably minimize AI’s environmental footprint to enable truly responsible AI.

<h4>Invited Talk 2: Teresa Nick (Microsoft)</h4>

    <h5 class="highlight"> Title: Data Center Cooling: Environmental Life Cycle Assessment</h5>
 <br>
    <h5 class="highlight">Abstract:
Optimizing data center cooling is a pivotal step towards sustainable computing and AI. The complexity of cooling optimization lies in balancing energy, water, and PFAS "forever" chemicals. Our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) compared four cooling systems—air, two-phase immersion, one-phase immersion, and cold plates—across general purpose data centers. We included details across software, IT hardware, support equipment, and the critical environment, simulating climate and weather at two locations. Our evaluation focused on energy use, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and blue water consumption. Preliminary findings pinpointed the most efficient units (virtual core or floating point operation), the significant effect of IT hardware refresh rates, and the scarcity of Environmental Product Declarations for data center components. Initial results indicate liquid cooling methods outperform air cooling, by reducing energy, emissions, and water usage.
