    <p>
To foster an inclusive environment, we accommodate individuals with family care responsibilities. By taking the following actions, we aspire to remove barriers and enable their full participation in the workshop.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Survey and Assess Needs.</strong>
    Prior to the workshop, we will survey registered participants to assess their specific family care needs. This information can inform the customization of services and resources to better meet the diverse requirements of participants.</li>
    <li><strong>Family Care Resource Guide.</strong> We will develop and distribute resource guide listing local family care services, including nearby daycare centers, family-friendly hotels, and other relevant facilities. This empowers participants to make informed choices based on their unique needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible Scheduling.</strong> We will design the workshop schedule with flexibility to accommodate participants with family care responsibilities. This will include well-spaced break times between sessions, session times that are aligned with daycare hours (generally avoidant of very early morning or late evening sessions).</li>
<!--     <li><strong>Networking for Families.</strong> We will organize networking events specifically for families, creating a supportive community for participants with shared family care responsibilities. This could include family-friendly outings meals, or social gatherings.</li>
    <li><strong>Designated Family Spaces.</strong> We will create designated family spaces at the workshop site where participants with families can comfortably attend to their family care responsibilities, providing a supportive environment.</li> -->
    </ul>
